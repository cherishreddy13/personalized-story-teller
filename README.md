1. Executive Summary
The Personalized AI Storyteller project is a web-based application designed to generate
personalized stories based on user inputs regarding their feelings, character names,
and character genders. Utilizing natural language processing (NLP) capabilities from the
Cohere API and sentiment analysis through the TextBlob library, the application aims to
create engaging narratives that resonate with users' emotions. The project also
incorporates audio features for an enhanced user experience, including background
music and sound effects corresponding to the generated story's mood.
2. Project Objectives
1. Story Generation: To develop an AI-driven story generation mechanism that
creates personalized stories based on user input.
2. Sentiment Analysis: To analyze user feelings through sentiment analysis to
influence the generated story's mood.
3. User Engagement: To enhance user experience through interactive elements,
including audio feedback and a visually appealing interface.
4. Accessibility: To ensure the application is user-friendly and accessible to a wide
range of users.
3. Introduction
3.1 Background
Storytelling has been an integral part of human culture, serving as a medium for sharing
experiences, morals, and entertainment. With the advent of technology, the way stories
are created and consumed has evolved. The Personalized AI Storyteller project aims to

harness the power of artificial intelligence to provide users with a unique storytelling
experience tailored to their emotions.
3.2 Problem Statement
In an era where digital content is abundant, users often seek personalized experiences
that resonate with their individual feelings and preferences. Traditional storytelling
methods may not cater to this demand, leading to a gap in the market for interactive and
personalized storytelling applications.
3.3 Significance of the Project
This project addresses the need for personalized storytelling by leveraging AI and
sentiment analysis. By allowing users to input their feelings and preferences, the
application creates a unique narrative that not only entertains but also connects with
users on an emotional level.
4. Technical Overview
4.1 Technologies Used
● Backend:
● Flask: A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python, used to
handle web requests and responses.
● Cohere API: A natural language processing service used to generate text
based on prompts.
● TextBlob: A Python library for processing textual data, used for sentiment
analysis.
● Frontend:

TechWizards
● HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the web application.
● JavaScript: For handling user interactions and making asynchronous
requests to the backend.
● Audio:
● Various audio files (e.g., happy, sad, neutral sounds) are used to provide
auditory feedback based on the mood of the generated story.
4.2 Architecture
The application follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, where:
● Model: The backend logic for story generation and sentiment analysis.
● View: The HTML/CSS frontend that presents the user interface.
● Controller: The Flask routes that handle user input and responses.
5. Implementation Details
5.1 Backend Implementation
● Flask Application Structure: The application is structured with routes to handle
different functionalities:
● /: The main route that renders the index page.
● /generate_story: A POST route that accepts user input, performs
sentiment analysis, and generates a story.
● Story Generation Function: The generate_story function constructs a prompt
based on user input and calls the Cohere API to generate a story.

● Sentiment Analysis Function: The get_sentiment function uses TextBlob to
analyze the polarity of the user input and classify it into happy, sad, or neutral
categories.
5.2 Frontend Implementation
● User Interface: The interface is designed to be intuitive, with clear prompts for
user input and buttons for interaction.
● JavaScript for Interactivity: The game.js file manages user interactions,
including:
● Handling button clicks to generate stories.
● Validating user input to ensure all fields are filled.
● Fetching data from the backend and updating the UI with the generated
story and mood.
● Audio Controls: Volume controls for background music and sound effects are
implemented to enhance the user experience.
5.3 Audio Integration
● Audio Elements: The application includes audio elements for background music
and mood-based sound effects, enhancing the storytelling experience.
● Volume Control: Users can adjust the volume of background music and sound
effects through sliders.

experience.
● Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring
usability across different devices.
7. Testing and Quality Assurance
7.1 Testing Methodology
● Unit Testing: Individual functions, such as generate_story and get_sentiment,
were tested for expected outputs based on sample inputs.
● Integration Testing: The interaction between the frontend and backend was
tested to ensure data was correctly sent and received.
● User Acceptance Testing: Feedback was gathered from potential users to identify
usability issues and areas for improvement.
